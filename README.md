# Authorship

This project used Fullstack Academy's Boilermaker as boilerplate under the MIT license. All modifications afterwards were by Daniel Kerr.

## Setup

This setup as it is now requires a Postgres database on the server and should work on a Unix machine. For Windows, authentication will be required; see the server/db.js file.

Always do `npm i` at the first.

To start it up, `npm run start-dev` should work on Unix machines. On Windows, enter `npm run build-client-watch` in one terminal and `npm run start-server` in another.
Port is 8080.
